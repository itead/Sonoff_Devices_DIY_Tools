# SONOFF DIY MODE API PROTOCOL

- Version: 1.4.0
- Date: 2019-07-31

## Introduction

**This API protocol is appropriate only for the DIY MODE device (Basic R3/RFR3/Mini) with firmware version of 3.3.0 or above **

Working Flow: 

Set up a specified SSID and password WiFi network, enter the DIY MODE by switching the GPIO 16 to Low-level (jumper plugged-in) , discover the device IP address through mDNS service,  control and operate the functions of the device according to the API that we offer.

New device is in eWeLink mode as default, if you want to use this API protocol to control the device, the device must be switched into DIY MODE.

|           Mode Switch            | Operation Mode |
| :------------------------------: | :------------: |
| Without Jumper (factory default) |  eWeLink MODE  |
|      With Plugged-in Jumper      |    DIY MODE    |



### DIY MODE Description



##### How to enter the DIY MODE:

1. Unscrew the screws on the bottom, open the bottom lid;
2. Plug-in the jumper on GPIO 16.

PS: you must disconnect the device from the power supply before you operate DIY MODE switch. 

##### DIY MODE LED blinking:

1. Fast single blinking -- The device does not connect to the WiFi (Router or Hotspot);

2. Fast double blinking -- The device connects to the WiFi successfully  able to be discovered through mDNS and respond the request from LAN network.

##### DIY MODE functions:

In DIY MODE, Any application can send API to control the device via LAN. (refer to API instruction page)



Note：

1. The user settings will be cleaned when change the operation mode from one to another. e.g. the device was in DIY MODE with a specific SSID and PW info setting, users would like to make a factory reset for the device SSID and PW, the steps would be, switch into eWeLink Mode, power on the device, at this time, the user setting of the device will be cleaned.
2. To switch into eWeLink Mode, you need to disconnect the device from the power supply first, plug-out the jumper for GPIO 16 high level.





### Set up the DIY MODE operating environment

#### 1. LAN（WiFi）requirement and setting

​	Requirement: 2.4GHz wifi and support mDNS service

​	Setting：

​			WiFi SSID: `sonoffDiy`

​			WiFi password: `20170618sn`

​			

#### 2. Device enter DIY MODE

First step: Disconnect the device from the power supply, unscrew the screws on the bottom, open the bottom lid, Plug-in the jumper on GPIO 16.

Second Step: Assembly the enclosure of the product, power on the device, it will automatically connect to the specific WiFi (SSID: `sonoffDiy` and password: `20170618sn`) 

LED blinking cases:

- Fast double blinking indicates that the device enter the DIY MODE and connect to the WiFi  (SSID: `sonoffDiy` and password: `20170618sn`)  successfully.
- Fast single blinking indicates that the device not connecting to WiFi. please check the WiFi SSID and password was set successfully or not, please check whether your firmware version is 3.3.0 (or above), check the WiFi router or hotspot support mDNS service or not.



#### 3. Test environment set up

3.1. Be sure that your PC and DIY MODE device connect to the same router (hotspot) and LAN

3.2. Open tool_01DIY85(3.3.0).exe

​	If the device was discovered in tool_01DIY85(3.3.0).exe, it means that **mDNS service is working** (you are able to discover the DIY MODE device via LAN), go ahead to the next step.

​	If the device was not discovered in tool_01DIY85(3.3.0).exe，please check：

- ​	PC and DIY MODE device are in the same router and LAN or not

- ​    Device is in DIY MODE and fast double blinking or not, if the device is not in DIY MODE, go to previous step of Device enter DIY MODE

- ​    The router (or hotspot) supports mDNS or not

#### 4. DIY MODE LAN discovery mechanism



DIY MODE LAN discovery implements IETF Multicast DNS protocol and DNS‑Based Service Discovery protocol. [1]



##### 4.1. Device mDNS service info publish process



The device publishes its own service (i.e. device capability) according to the mDNS/DNS-SD standard discovery protocol when the device is connected to LAN (Local Area Network).

The fields defined by eWeLink are as follows:

|       Attribute       | Description                                                  | Example            |
| :-------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
|      IP Address       | The LAN IP Address is obtained through DHCP instead of the Link‐Local address of IPv4/IPv6 |                    |
|       Hostname        | The Hostname must be unique in LAN; <br/>Format: eWeLink_[Device ID] | eWeLink_10000000d0 |
|     Service Type      | ewelink._tcp                                                 |                    |
| Service Instance Name | The Service Instance Name must be unique in LAN; <br/>Max: 63 bytes (21 UTF8 Characters) |                    |
|      TXT Record       | One or more strings; No exceeded 255 bytes for each string;        No exceeded 1300 bytes for the entire TXT record; |                    |

- **TXT Record note**：
  
  1. TXT Record must contain below strings:
  
  "txtvers=1", "id=[device ID]", "type=[device type]", "apivers=[device API interface version]", "seq=[TXT Record serial number]", "data1=[device information]";
  
  2. Optional strings:
  
  "data2=[device information]", "data3=[device information]", "data4=[device information]"
  
  3.  “seq=[TXT record sequence number]” indicates the order in which the TXT records are updated (the order in which the device status is updated). It is recommended to be a positive integer that increments from 1 (reset to 1 when the device restarts);
  
  4. When the device information is longer than 249 bytes, the first 249 bytes must be stored in data1, and the remaining bytes are divided by length 249, which are stored in data2, data3, and data4. The complete device information format is a JSON object, for instance:
  
  data1=
  
  {"switch":"on","startup":"stay","pulse":"on","pulseWidth":2000,"ssid":"eWeLink","otaUnlock":true}

Whenever content other than seq changes, such as Service Instance Name is modified, device information is updated, etc., the device must multicast the corresponding DNS record (including the incremented seq) according to the mDNS/DNS-SD standard.



##### 4.2. Discovery Process for Device Service

The discovery process must follow the mDNS/DNS-SD Discovery protocol to discover the Sonoff DIY MODE device with “_ewelink._tcp” service type when your application or client connect with Internet (WiFi or Ethernet);

Here is the discovery process:

1. Search in the LAN for all devices with the service type _ewelink._tcp through the DNS PTR record.
2. Get the Hostname and Port of device service via parsing out the device DNS SRV record.
3. Get the info of “device ID”, “Service Type”, “device API interface version” and “device information” via parsing out the device DNS TXT Record.

Note:

1. When the “device type” of the device service does not match with the “device type” of your application or client, or the device API interface version of the device service is higher than your application or client’s, the application or client should not parse out the “device information” and call the device API interface, but prompt the specific reason for users why the device cannot be controlled via LAN and suggest to upgrade the application or client.
2. The application or client get the IP address of the device via DNS A record when the device API interface is about to be called.



##### 4.3. Device info by runing `mdns.py` file

（Discover the device via mDNS and get the info of device）

```
1000806ace  192.168.1.104  8081  {b'txtvers': b'1', b'id': b'1000806ace', b'type': b'diy_plug', b'apivers': b'1', b'seq': b'853', b'data1':b'{"switch":"off","startup":"off","pulse":"off","pulseWidth":500,"rssi":-70}'}
```



### Device API Control Protocol（HTTP POST）

The device must open the HTTP server in the port declared by the DNS SRV record before the device publishes its services; the device publishes the capabilities through a HTTP-based RESTful API. Because of the LAN's security and device's limited computing power, this document recommends that the device provides HTTP instead of HTTPS interface.

The device type is diy_plug(type=diy_plug) and the device API interface version is 1 (apivers=1).
